# ðŸ“Š Pattern Completion Analysis - Interactive Charts Guide

## Overview

The backtesting results are now organized in **3 tabs**:

### 1. ðŸ“Š Results Tab
- Text-based summary (original view)
- Comprehensive statistics
- Pattern breakdown

#### Chart 2: Success Composition (Pie Chart)
- Shows percentage breakdown of successful patterns
- ABCD vs XABCD distribution
- Displays count and percentage on each slice
- Color-coded: ABCD (blue), XABCD (orange)

#### Chart 3: Success Rate Comparison (Bar Chart)

- **Color-coded by performance:**
  - Green: â‰¥70% success rate
  - Yellow: 50-69% success rate
  - Red: <50% success rate
- Shows percentage on top of bars
- Displays count (success/total) inside bars
