## CRITICAL MISSING DATA FOR TRADING

### 1. ❌ FIBONACCI LEVELS (MOST IMPORTANT!)
**What's Missing**:
- No Fibonacci retracement levels (23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%)
- No Fibonacci extension levels (127.2%, 141.4%, 161.8%, 200%, 261.8%)
- No price targets for each Fib level
- No actual entry/exit prices from Fib analysis

**Why Critical**: These are the PRIMARY trading signals!

**What's Missing**:
- Entry Price (where trade was opened)
- Exit Price (where trade closed)
- Stop Loss Price
- Take Profit Prices (TP1, TP2, TP3)
- Trade Direction (Long/Short)
- Trade Duration (bars held)
- Trade PnL ($)
- Trade PnL (%)

### 3. ❌ D POINT INFORMATION
**What's Missing**:
- D Point Bar Index
- D Point Price
- D Point Date
- Actual vs Projected D (accuracy)
- Zone Entry Bar/Date/Price

### 4. ❌ PATTERN QUALITY METRICS
**What's Missing**:
- Pattern Score/Quality (0-100)
- Ratio Accuracy (how close to ideal)
- PRZ Width (tight vs wide zones)
- Volume at key points
- Time-based metrics (formation speed)

### 5. ❌ RISK/REWARD DATA
**What's Missing**:
- Risk/Reward Ratio
- Win Rate %
- Average Win/Loss
- Max Drawdown
- Sharpe Ratio
- Profit Factor

### 6. ❌ PATTERN LIFECYCLE TRACKING
**What's Missing**:
- C Point Updates (how many times C moved)
- PRZ Recalculations (when/why)
- Dismissal Reason (specific cause)
- Time in each status
- Final Outcome Details

## WHAT YOU NEED FOR LIVE TRADING

**Essential Data for Real Trading**:
1. **Entry Signals**: Which Fib level triggered entry
2. **Stop Loss**: Where to place protective stop
3. **Take Profits**: Multiple TP levels based on Fibs
4. **Position Size**: Based on risk per trade
5. **Trade Management**: When to move SL to breakeven
6. **Exit Signals**: Which Fib level or condition exits

**Currently Missing ALL of Above!**

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Immediate**: Add Fibonacci levels to Pattern Details sheet
2. **Immediate**: Add Trades sheet with full trade data
3. **Short-term**: Add Pattern Performance sheet
4. **Short-term**: Add Fibonacci Analysis sheet
5. **Medium-term**: Add Daily Performance tracking
6. **Long-term**: Add advanced analytics and correlations

**The Fibonacci levels are THE MOST CRITICAL missing piece - they are your actual trading signals!**
