# Success Rate Investigation Report
## Why Only 1 out of 216 Patterns Succeeded

### Executive Summary

**Finding:** The low success rate (0.5%) is NOT caused by faulty success/failure logic. Instead, **99.5% of patterns (215/216) never reached the PRZ zone**.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Pattern Status Breakdown (216 total patterns):
- ✅ **Success: 1 (0.5%)** - Entered PRZ and reversed successfully
- ❌ **Failed: 0 (0%)** - No patterns failed (because none entered PRZ and violated)
- 🚫 **Dismissed: 136 (63.0%)** - All dismissed BEFORE entering PRZ
- ⏳ **Pending: 79 (36.6%)** - Never reached PRZ zone

#### Critical Insight: PRZ Entry Rate

```
Total patterns: 216
Entered PRZ zone: 1 (0.5%)
Never entered PRZ: 215 (99.5%)
```

**This is the core issue:** Patterns are not reaching the PRZ zone where they can succeed or fail.

#### Dismissal Reasons (136 patterns)

All 136 dismissed patterns were dismissed for **structure break**:
- 76 patterns (55.9%): "Structure broken - price below B" (bullish patterns)
- 60 patterns (44.1%): "Structure broken - price above B" (bearish patterns)

**None of the dismissed patterns had entered the PRZ** before being dismissed.

#### Success/Failure Logic (Working Correctly)

The zone entry success/failure logic in `pattern_tracking_utils.py:1375-1520` is working correctly:

**Success Criteria:**
- Bullish: `price_high > prz_max` (price exits above PRZ)
- Bearish: `price_low < prz_min` (price exits below PRZ)

**Failure Criteria:**
- Bullish: `price_low < prz_min` (price violates PRZ downward)
- Bearish: `price_high > prz_max` (price violates PRZ upward)

The 1 pattern that succeeded followed this logic correctly.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Why are patterns being dismissed before PRZ entry?

The dismissal logic (`pattern_tracking_utils.py:1035-1090`) checks for **structure break at B point**:

**Bullish patterns:** Dismissed if `price_low < B_price`
**Bearish patterns:** Dismissed if `price_high > B_price`

This is a valid harmonic pattern rule - if price breaks below B on a bullish pattern (or above B on bearish), the pattern structure is invalidated.

#### Why don't patterns reach the PRZ?

Two possible explanations:

1. **Market volatility:** 63% dismissal rate suggests Bitcoin's volatility frequently invalidates patterns before completion

2. **PRZ is too far from C point:** The remaining 36.6% (79 patterns) are still pending, meaning price hasn't reached the PRZ zone yet (or the backtest ended before they could)

### Comparison with Previous Results

From the summary, it appears you previously had:
- More patterns entering the PRZ
- Multiple successes and failures
- Better completion rate

**What changed?** Need to investigate:
1. Detection parameters (extremum_length, detection_interval)
2. PRZ calculation logic
3. Pattern validation strictness

### Recommendations

#### Option 1: Relax B Point Dismissal (NOT Recommended)
- Loosen the B point structure break dismissal
- Would allow more patterns to reach PRZ
- BUT violates standard harmonic pattern rules

#### Option 2: Investigate PRZ Distance (Recommended)
- Check if PRZ zones are calculated too far from C point
- Compare PRZ distances with successful pattern
- May need to adjust Fibonacci projection ratios

#### Option 3: Analyze Pattern Quality (Recommended)
- Review the 79 pending patterns - why haven't they reached PRZ?
- Check if detection is too lenient (detecting low-quality patterns)
- Compare with patterns that actually succeed

#### Option 4: Review Detection Parameters (Recommended)
- Current: `extremum_length=1`, `detection_interval=1`
- May be detecting too many weak patterns
- Consider increasing extremum_length to find stronger swing points

### Next Steps

1. **Analyze the 1 successful pattern:**
   - What made it different?
   - PRZ distance from C point?
   - Time to reach PRZ?
   - Market conditions?

2. **Sample 10 dismissed patterns:**
   - How many bars from C to dismissal?
   - How close did price get to PRZ before dismissal?
   - Was dismissal inevitable or marginal?

3. **Sample 10 pending patterns:**
   - How far is price from PRZ?
   - How long have they been pending?
   - Are they likely to ever reach PRZ?

4. **Compare with historical successful backtests:**
   - What parameters were different?
   - What was the PRZ entry rate?
   - What was the dismissal rate?
