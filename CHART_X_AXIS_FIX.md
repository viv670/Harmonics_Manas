# Chart X-Axis Fix - Using Timestamps Instead of Bar Indices

## Problem
The pattern chart window was showing bar indices (0, 1, 2, 3...) on the X-axis instead of actual dates, making it difficult to understand when patterns occurred.

Additionally, pattern points A, B, C were appearing in a vertical line because they were all at the same position.

## Root Cause

### Issue 1: Bar Indices on X-Axis
The code was using integer indices as X coordinates instead of timestamps:
1. `CandlestickItem` was using `i` (loop index) as X coordinate
2. Pattern points were using `display_idx` (relative position) as X coordinate
3. Candlestick data was prepared with `reset_index(drop=True)`, removing timestamps

### Issue 2: Vertical Line Points
Pattern points stored in the signal database were likely all zeros: `{"A": 0, "B": 0, "C": 0}` or very small bar indices, causing them to appear at the same X position.

## Solution

### Fix 1: Use Unix Timestamps as X Coordinates

#### Modified `CandlestickItem` (line 86-102)
Changed from using integer index `i` to using Unix timestamp:

```python
# Use timestamp as X coordinate (convert to Unix timestamp in seconds)
x_pos = timestamp.timestamp() if isinstance(timestamp, pd.Timestamp) else float(timestamp) / 1000.0

# Use x_pos instead of i for all drawing
painter.drawLine(pg.QtCore.QPointF(x_pos, low), pg.QtCore.QPointF(x_pos, high))
painter.drawRect(pg.QtCore.QRectF(x_pos - width/2, min(open_price, close), width, body_height))
```

#### Modified Data Preparation (line 463)
Changed from resetting index to keeping timestamps:

```python
# Before:
candles = CandlestickItem(display_data.reset_index(drop=True))

# After:
candles = CandlestickItem(display_data)
```

#### Modified Pattern Point Plotting (line 490-495)
Changed from using display indices to timestamps:

```python
# Before:
actual_idx = self.df.index.get_loc(point_time)
display_idx = actual_idx - display_min
x_coords.append(display_idx)

# After:
x_pos = point_time.timestamp() if isinstance(point_time, pd.Timestamp) else float(point_time) / 1000.0
x_coords.append(x_pos)
```

#### Modified Crosshair Logic (line 629-681)
Changed from integer index lookup to timestamp-based lookup:

```python
# Before:
x = int(mousePoint.x())
if 0 <= x < len(self.display_data):
    row = self.display_data.iloc[x]

# After:
x = mousePoint.x()  # Unix timestamp in seconds
mouse_time = pd.to_datetime(x, unit='s')
idx = np.argmin(np.abs(self.display_data.index - mouse_time))
row = self.display_data.iloc[idx]
x_pos = timestamp.timestamp()
self.vLine.setPos(x_pos)
```

## Technical Details

### Unix Timestamp Conversion
- PyQtGraph's `DateAxisItem` expects Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch) as X coordinates
- Convert pandas Timestamp to Unix seconds: `timestamp.timestamp()`
- Convert Unix seconds back to pandas Timestamp: `pd.to_datetime(x, unit='s')`

### Benefits
1. **X-axis shows proper dates**: DateAxisItem automatically formats Unix timestamps as readable dates
2. **Accurate point positioning**: Pattern points appear at correct dates, not at wrong bar indices
3. **Consistent coordinate system**: All chart elements use the same timestamp-based X coordinates
4. **Proper zoom/pan**: Works correctly with timestamp-based data

### Files Modified
- `pattern_chart_window.py`:
  - Line 86-102: CandlestickItem drawing logic
  - Line 463: Candlestick data preparation
  - Line 490-495: Pattern point X coordinate calculation
  - Line 629-681: Crosshair mouse movement logic

## Expected Outcome

### Before:
- X-axis: `0, 50, 100, 150, 200, ...`
- Points A, B, C all at same position (vertical line)

### After:
- X-axis: `Jan 2025, Feb 2025, Mar 2025, ...`
- Points A, B, C at correct dates (spread across time)

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Open Active Signals window
2. Click "ðŸ“Š View Chart" for any pattern
3. Check X-axis shows dates instead of numbers
4. Verify pattern points A, B, C are at different positions
5. Hover mouse over chart - OHLC box should show correct dates
6. Zoom/pan should work smoothly with date-based coordinates

## Potential Issues

### Issue: Points Still in Vertical Line
If points still appear in a vertical line after this fix, the problem is in the **signal database**. The `points_json` field likely contains incorrect bar indices (all zeros).

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check console output: `DEBUG: points_json = ...`
2. If you see `{"A": 0, "B": 0, "C": 0}`, the issue is in pattern detection
3. Investigate `scan_and_populate_signals.py` and pattern detection functions
4. Ensure pattern detection returns correct bar indices

### Issue: 1970 Dates Still Showing
If dates show as 1970, the CSV file likely has incorrect timestamps.

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check the CSV file's Timestamp column
2. Verify values are > 1e10 (milliseconds) or reasonable Unix timestamps
3. Check data loading logic in `loadChartData()` (line 262-287)
