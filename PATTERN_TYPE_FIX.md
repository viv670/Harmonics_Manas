# Pattern Type Identification Fix

## The Problem
User reported seeing "ABCD TheHitman1_bull, TheHitman2_bull" patterns with point B not being the minimum between A and C.

## Root Cause
**TheHitman patterns are XABCD patterns (5 points: X, A, B, C, D), NOT ABCD patterns (4 points: A, B, C, D)**

### Key Differences:
- **ABCD patterns**: B MUST be the extremum (min for bullish, max for bearish) between A and C
- **XABCD patterns**: B is a retracement point, NOT necessarily the extremum between A and C

## Why This Matters
For XABCD patterns like TheHitman:
- Point B is defined by the AB/XA retracement ratio (not by being the extremum)
- There can be other candlesticks between A and C that go beyond B
- The validation rules are different from ABCD patterns

## The Fix
The ABCD validation I added (ensuring B is the extremum) is CORRECT and should stay.
The issue is that TheHitman patterns should NEVER be treated as ABCD patterns.

### What needs to be checked:
1. **Pattern Detection**: Ensure TheHitman patterns are detected by XABCD detection functions, not ABCD
2. **Pattern Display**: Ensure the GUI shows TheHitman as XABCD (with X point visible)
3. **Pattern Validation**: XABCD patterns use different validation rules than ABCD

## Verification
Run this to confirm TheHitman is XABCD:
```python
from pattern_ratios_2_Final import ABCD_PATTERN_RATIOS, XABCD_PATTERN_RATIOS

# TheHitman should ONLY be in XABCD_PATTERN_RATIOS
print("TheHitman in ABCD:", any('TheHitman' in k for k in ABCD_PATTERN_RATIOS.keys()))
print("TheHitman in XABCD:", any('TheHitman' in k for k in XABCD_PATTERN_RATIOS.keys()))
```

## Summary
- The ABCD validation (B must be extremum) is working correctly
- TheHitman patterns are XABCD patterns and shouldn't be subject to ABCD validation
- If you're seeing TheHitman displayed as "ABCD", that's the bug to fix
